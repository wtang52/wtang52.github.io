title: Tryhackme learning note - NMAP
---

NMAP is a tool to aggressively scan for open ports on a remote machine. It is crucial that we being any attack with a port scan. Once we identify opened ports, we then can enumerate through services that are running on each port. Keep in mind that ports can be altered especially in a CTS setting; thus, making it even more imperative that we perform appropriate enumeration on the target machine.

NMAP is currently the industry standard and no other port scanning tool comes close to matching its functionality. It has a scripting engine which can be used to scan for vulnerabilities, and in some cases even allows attackers to perform the exploits. 

note: ports 0 through 1023 are defined as well-know ports.
